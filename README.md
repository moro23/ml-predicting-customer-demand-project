## Project Name: Predicting Customer Demand. 

## Problem Description
Imagine that you’re running a car dealership in Quebec, Canada. You are using a standard business model for retail: you buy cars from a manufacturer at a low price and then sell those cars to individual customers at higher prices. Every month, you need to decide how many cars you’ll order from the manufacturer. 
If you order too many cars, you’ll be unable to sell them all quickly, resulting in high storage costs or cash flow problems. If you order too few cars, you
won’t be able to meet your customers’ demands.

Ordering the right number of cars is important. But what is the right number? The answer depends on certain business considerations, such as the cash in your bank account and how much you want to grow - but in a typical month, the right number of cars to order is exactly the number of cars that customers will want to buy during the coming month. Since we can’t see into the future, we need to forecast the demand and place an order based on our forecast. 

## Objective
To use linear regression and it variants to obtain a forecast of the next month's demand.
